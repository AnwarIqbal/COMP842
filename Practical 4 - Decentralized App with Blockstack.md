# Create an app with Blockstack
This is based on the "Hello Blockstack" tutorial written for OSX users. If you are using a mac/linux, the blockstack version will be better to follow: [Hello, Blockstack Tutorial](https://docs.blockstack.org/browser/hello-blockstack.html). For this I am using Windows 10 which should be compatible with the lab.

First we will install or verify npm which is the package manager for node.js. To check the version and find out if npm is installed, open a command prompt and type `npm -v`. Here I have version 6.4.1 which comes with node.js.

If you need to install it, head over to https://nodejs.org/en/ and download the installer for Windows.
